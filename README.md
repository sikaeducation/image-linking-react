# Image Linking React

There are two image files in the root of this project, `drake-no.jpg` and `drake-yes.jpg`. Display both of them in `App.js`, but import `drake-yes.jpg` as an asset and link to `drake-no.jpg` with a regular URL. Note that you'll need to move both files to appropriate paths in the repo.
